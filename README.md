One of my first projects, based on a real barbershop located in Madison, WI for one of my cousins! It is in the style of a modern, dynamic website.

Including details about services, ameneties, store hours, location, barbers as well as scheduling linked to the real-world location!

## Project Structure:

### HTML:
- `index.html`: The main file of the project that contains the user interface and markup.
- `services.html`: Provides avaiable services as well as their corresponding prices.

- `hours.html`: Displays store hours, contact (phone number and email), business location, as well as a Google Maps iFrame.

### CSS:
- `style.css`: All of the significant styles are located here! As well as the Tailwind CSS import!


### JavaScript:
